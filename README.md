Diamonds
========

About
-----

This is the clone of [Diamonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_%28video_game%29), an old Macintosh game I loved as a kid.

Currently I'm just working on implementing features and levels from the original game (which was really hard!) but eventually I'll have a more reasonable difficulty mode.

I used the [Crafty.js](http://craftyjs.com/) game library for my game. It's a very light weight library that provided me with an entity system and handled cross platform canvas manipulations easily.

A (probably) up to date version is on my site at [http://tylerwymer.com/diamonds/index.html](http://tylerwymer.com/diamonds/index.html).

It can also be opened locally as everything needed is included.

Controls
--------

* Left and right arrow keys to move
* E - Opens custom level editor (still a work in progress)
* D - Delete any existing custom levels and restart game
